 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks<br><br>
Problem Statement<br>

Write a Python program that:<br>

Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.<br>

Asks the user to input a student's name.<br>

Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.<br>

If the student’s name is not found, display an appropriate message.<br>
<br>
Approach
<br>
A dictionary is created with names as keys and marks as values.<br>

The program asks the user for a name.<br>

Using the dictionary, the program checks if the name exists.<br>

If the name exists → prints the marks.<br>

If not → prints "Student not found".<br>

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing <br>
Problem Statement<br>

Write a Python program that:<br>

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.<br>

Extracts the first five elements from the list.<br>

Reverses these extracted elements.<br>

Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.<br>
<br><br>
Approach

A list of numbers [1, 2, ..., 10] is created.<br>

Using slicing ([:5]), the first five elements are extracted.<br>

These elements are then reversed using slicing ([::-1]).<br>

Both the extracted and reversed lists are printed.<br>
